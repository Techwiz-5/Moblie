# Project T1 Ambulance

A is a preety basic system implemented using Flutter, Dart, Firebase, OpenStreetMap .

In emergency situations, every second counts. The ambulance calling app was created to solve the problem of time. Instead of having to fumble around for a phone number, you just need to open the T1 Ambulance app and press call. The system will automatically determine your location and dispatch the nearest ambulance to the scene.
